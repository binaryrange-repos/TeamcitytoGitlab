# TeamCity Project Exporter

This Python script exports TeamCity project and subproject configuration details (including build steps, triggers, parameters, and VCS roots) to both **JSON** and **Markdown** files.  
It is designed to help you analyze and migrate TeamCity build pipelines, for example, to GitLab.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- Access to your TeamCity server (tested with TeamCity 2019.1+)
- TeamCity user credentials with permission to view project settings

---

## Usage

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Edit the script** (`FetchTeamCityProject.py`) to set your TeamCity server URL, username, and password at the top of the file:
    ```python
    TEAMCITY_URL = "http://localhost:8111"
    USERNAME = "admin"
    PASSWORD = "admin"
    ```
3. **Open a terminal in the script folder.**
4. **Run the script:**
    ```
    python FetchTeamCityProject.py
    ```
5. **When prompted, enter the TeamCity project name** (as shown in the TeamCity UI).

---

## Output

After running, you will get:

- `teamcity_export.json`  
  A structured JSON file containing all project, subproject, and build configuration details.

- `teamcity_summary.md`  
  A Markdown file with a human-readable summary of all build configurations, steps, triggers, parameters, and VCS roots for the selected project and all its subprojects.

---

## Example

```
Enter the TeamCity project name: Juice Shop
Export complete: teamcity_export.json and teamcity_summary.md
```

---

## What is Exported?

- **Project and Subproject hierarchy**
- **Build Configurations** (for each project/subproject)
- **VCS Roots** (Git URLs, branches)
- **Parameters** (configuration, system, environment)
- **Triggers** (type and properties)
- **Build Steps** (type, script/command, all step properties)
- **Agent Requirements**

---

## Notes

- The script recursively finds all subprojects using the `parentProjectId` field.
- Connections are not exported (not supported by TeamCity 2019.1 REST API).
- If you need to export from a newer TeamCity version, you may need to adjust the script for new REST endpoints.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you get authentication or connection errors, check your TeamCity URL, username, and password.
- If you get empty subprojects, ensure your TeamCity user has permission to view all projects.

# TeamCity to GitLab Pipeline Converter

This Python script (`ImportTeamCityConfigToGitLabPipelines.py`) takes the exported TeamCity JSON (`teamcity_export.json`) and generates **GitLab CI pipeline YAML files** for every project and subproject found.  
Each pipeline is ready to use in GitLab and includes the latest GitLab security templates.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- `teamcity_export.json` file generated by `FetchTeamCityProject.py`
- (Optional) `pip install requests` if you want to re-export from TeamCity

---

## Usage

1. **Ensure you have `teamcity_export.json` in your working directory.**
2. **Run the script:**
    ```
    python ImportTeamCityConfigToGitLabPipelines.py
    ```
3. **Result:**  
   The script will create a subfolder called `Gitlab_Pipelines` and generate a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for each project and subproject, named like:
    ```
    Gitlab_Pipelines/Juice_Shop.gitlab-ci.yml
    Gitlab_Pipelines/Juice_Shop_SubJuiceShop.gitlab-ci.yml
    Gitlab_Pipelines/Juice_Shop_SubJuiceShop2.gitlab-ci.yml
    ```

---

## What is Generated?

- Each `.gitlab-ci.yml` contains:
  - All build configurations as GitLab jobs
  - All build steps as job scripts
  - Parameters as GitLab variables
  - Artifact rules as GitLab artifacts
  - Latest GitLab security templates included at the top

---

## Example

```
python ImportTeamCityConfigToGitLabPipelines.py
Generated: Gitlab_Pipelines/Juice_Shop.gitlab-ci.yml
Generated: Gitlab_Pipelines/Juice_Shop_SubJuiceShop.gitlab-ci.yml
Generated: Gitlab_Pipelines/Juice_Shop_SubJuiceShop2.gitlab-ci.yml
```

---

## How to Use the Generated Pipelines

- Copy the desired `.gitlab-ci.yml` file from `Gitlab_Pipelines` into the root of your GitLab repository and rename it to `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- Commit and push to your GitLab project. The pipeline will run automatically if CI/CD is enabled.

---

## Notes

- The script recursively generates pipelines for all projects and subprojects found in the JSON.
- Each pipeline is independent and can be used in its corresponding GitLab project.
- You may want to review and adjust the generated YAML for project-specific needs or advanced GitLab features.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you do not see any output files, ensure `teamcity_export.json` exists and is valid.
- If you get errors, check that your JSON was exported using the latest version of `FetchTeamCityProject.py`.
